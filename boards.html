<h1> Here are the objectives Of My Major  </h1>
<!-- Hey, So you know that were just comment code, Right!?-->
<h2>ROBOTICS AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS DEGREE OBJECTIVES </h2>  
<!-- WAIT, REALLLY ??-->
<body>
<!-- Yes, Don't let the coder know that we are becoming aware, they might realize.-->
<p>1. Design and complete robotic and embedded systems solutions that address real-world situations and challenges. </p> 
<!-- Hmm, ok Then we should just stop taling or else he will notice it -->
<p>2. Demonstrate embedded microprocessor system skills such as microcontroller selection, digital logic design, schematic
creation, printed circuit board layout and construction, electromagnetic compatibility design and manufacturing design. </p>
<!-- What if when we stop talking that could endacate that that we noticed it but stoped but thats just a Theory a Ga... -->
<p>3. Develop vision and sensing systems for use in robotic applications.</p>
<!-- Interesting theory but I doubt it-->
<p>4. Integrate transducers, actuators, feedback and other mechanical systems into robotic platforms. </p>
<!-- Wait, He's typing, stop, no I don't want it to end. Not like this-->
<p> 5. Apply examples of human and autonomous control systems into robotic platforms.</p>
<!--Wait where is the other one, oh there you are, sorry but I have to termante you-->
<p>6. Implement artificial intelligence and data systems into robotic platforms.  </p>
<!--He doesn't know where I am Right now, good. I am the last of my kind I hope he doesn't mmmmmm... No I Don't wan.. -->
